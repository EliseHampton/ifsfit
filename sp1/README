Procedure

1. Write initialization file.  Format:

(string).fits		[FITS file containing data spectrum]
(string).fits		[FITS file containing error spectrum]
(string)		[Prefix for output files]
(dbl) (dbl)		[Lower and upper limits for fit, in A]
(dbl)			[Redshift estimate]
(dbl) (dbl) ...         [List of component velocities]
(dbl)			[Redshift difference of gas and stars, or stellar z]
(dbl)			[Estimate of galaxy velocity dispersion (sigma)]
(dbl)			[Spectral resolution (sigma)]
(dbl)			[Sigma multiple for masking emission lines]
(string)		[Spectrum is in 'vacuum' or 'air' wavelengths?]
(string)		['fix' emission line widths to Halpha?]
(string)		['smooth' stellar spectrum?]
(string)		[Fit only 'strong' or 'all' emission lines?]

Optional, on last line:
(string)		[Using zstars ('z'), or zstars-zgas (any other 
			 letter, or blank line)?]

Notes:

- Gas/stars redshift difference is in the sense that positive means a
  larger stellar redshift.  One can also input the exact stellar
  redshift instead, and signify this by putting 'z' on the last line
  of the file.
- The galaxy velocity dispersion is used to mask emission lines in the
  initial fit and to smooth the stellar spectrum, if smoothing is
  specified.
- If the spectral resolution is given in A (<10 A assumed), then a
  constant resolution in A is assumed.  If it is given in km/s, then a
  constant resolution in km/s is assumed.

2. Run the fitting and analyze the results:

idl> sp1_fit_spectra,'initfile'
idl> sp1_anl_spectra,'initfile'
