     Renamed.
     Added standardized documentation.
     Added copyright and license statements.
     Created unique procedure and function names.
     Re-wrote for more general use, including AGN spectra.
     Removed subroutines in lib/, which included an old version of
       BVLS, an old version of spec1d (which I think is code from
       J. Moustakas), and old version of dust routines that probably
       originated in IDLUTILS.
