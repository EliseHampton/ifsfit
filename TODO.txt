+ Read PPXF paper.
+ Rename and finish documenting each routine (32 of 32 completed; last
  worked on 2013nov25).
+ Propagate new treatment of line list (as hash).
+ Deprecate old stellar fitting.
+ Incorporate PPXF into stellar fitting.
+ Get software working again.
  + New rubric for dealing with IFSF_FITSPEC calling parameters and
    contents of initdat structure.
  + New rubric for initialization routine: should be as bare-bones as
    possible; common tasks should be handled as much as possible by
    IFSF.
  + hashes: propagate through code and only turn into structures when
    necessary
+ Get sky routine working.
+ Get rid of instances of readcol300 (--> readcol).
+ Update README.txt.
- Write routine to do second-pass fitting.
